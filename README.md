# ImgCompression
ImgCompression is the compression of images using different open source image libraries using java.
Here there are three different libraries are used. 
First one is the ImageMagick,second is the DIP i.e Digital Image Processing (provided by the java) and the third one is ImageJ.
All three libraries are compared on the basis of different image variants with different image quality. 
Different library can compress image with different quality.
Comparison is used to choose appropriate library according to demand, 
as during sending image on network it is required to send image with minimum size but with maximum quality,as its the first choice for reducing bandwidth usage.
